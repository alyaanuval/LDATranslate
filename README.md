# Translating Loss Data Analytics

*Chapter Preview.* We understand that users may prefer reading the Loss Data Analytics book in their native language. This chapter explains how the user can translate text within the book to suit this preference.

## Example Translation
Before getting into how you can translate the book, you may refer here for an example. In this example, we translate the section [**Relevance of Analytics**](https://alyaanuval.github.io/LDATranslate/C-Intro.html#S:Intro) under **Chapter 1: Introduction to Loss Data Analytics** from English to Malay.

## Loss Data Analytics on GitHub
Start by downloading the Loss Data Analytics project stored on GitHub. To do this:

* Go to our project page [here](https://github.com/OpenActTexts/Loss-Data-Analytics).
* Click the green "Clone or Download" button.
* Select "Download ZIP"" and extract the files onto your computer.

## Loss Data Analytics R Project
Once you have extracted all the files, you can now access the Loss Data Analytics R Project to make changes and re-build the book to implement those changes locally on your computer. To do so:

* Open the Loss Data Analytics R Project so that you can make changes to the project on R Studio. It has a blue cube icon next to the project name.
* On the bottom right, you should be able to view all project files.
* You will see a "Chapters" folder. Open the chapter which you wish to translate. 

## Google Translate
* Copy the parts which you wish to translate. We suggest copying the text paragraph by paragraph.
* Paste the copied text into Google Translate [here](https://translate.google.com/).
* Copy the translation and replace the English text.

## Re-build The Book
* At the top right in your R Studio environment, there should be a "Build" tab.
* Under this tab, there is a button saying "Build Book" with a hammer icon beside it. Click the arrow pointing downwards on that button.
* You will see a drop down list. Choose "bookdown:gitbook".
* An R window should open and you should be able to click "Open in Browser." By clicking this, you can view the re-built book on your web browser.
* Additionally, you can access this html webpage by going to the "docs" folder and clicking the "index" file.

## Additional Notes
* For help on `R Bookdown`, you may refer [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
* You may repeat the copying, pasting and building process as many times as necessary.
